# Greenwood Library Website Project 

In these project, I am practicing repository cloning, creating and working with branches in git, git staging, commiting, pushing of changes for multiple developers as well as creating pull request, merging them and also resolving any potential conflicts that may arise.

## Git Clone

The git clone command is used to create a copy of a specific repository or branch within a repository

To use Git clone type the syntax `git clone`
